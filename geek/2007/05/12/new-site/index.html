              <h1>New Site</h1>
              
            
            <p>Well, I finally got my act together and put together a website.  I have a chronic problem of half-completing projects and then just leaving them languishing.  I&#8217;m particularly bad with domain names &#8212; I get an idea for a site and snatch up some witty and apropos domain names&#8230; only to never fully develop the idea into a working site.  Part of my problem is that I keep making my plans more and more intricate until it simply becomes impossible for my limited skill-set.</p>


	<p>The impetus for this site is three-fold (and it therefore will have three sections once completed)...</p>
            
            <div id="extended">
              <ol>
	<li>I wanted to create a decent gallery implementation that I can lock down to very private settings to allow my grandfather and his editor to view photos I took for his upcoming book about Mennonites in Paraguay.  I don&#8217;t want to release the pictures into the open waters of the Internet as the publisher wouldn&#8217;t be very happy if they noticed some competitor using images earmarked for them in some other publication or whatnot.  And I wanted a place to put my own personal pictures for the world to see.  I think this site will address both of those needs&#8230; although the photos section of the site is still under development.</li>
		<li>I wanted to document some of the geeky tech-related projects on which I&#8217;m currently working.  I personally rely very heavily on the internet for resources in developing some of these projects, and in some cases, internet documentation is very scarce.  Recently, I&#8217;ve been learning Ruby and Rails and they have a great convention called <acronym title="Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym>.  I really think that it should be extended into a global version&#8212;if someone out there has accomplished the same goal you&#8217;re after, why should both parties need to develop the solution independently?  Especially if it&#8217;s simply hobby projects.  So, I&#8217;ll be putting stuff like that into the <a href="../../../../index.html">geeky</a> section of things here.  Expect to see stuff about <span class="caps">PIC</span> microcontrollers, <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net"><span class="caps">SDCC</span></a>, <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a>, Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span>, <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.radiantcms.org">Radiant</a>.  And maybe some other half-completed projects, too.</li>
		<li>While I was at it, I figured I may as well create a blog to comment on interesting stuff that happens to me during the day.  I&#8217;m going to try to make it slightly more interesting than the majority of blahgs out there, but we&#8217;ll see how I do.  First and foremost, I&#8217;m going to try to include photos or other such interesting visual with each post&#8230; that will help keep things moving at the least.  And give me a reason to take out my camera for photos.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>The one site-management package that I&#8217;ve found that can do all of the above and can <em>gracefully</em> mix and match them together is Radiant.  It&#8217;s still fledgeling, and I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to anyone who is shy about writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>/CSS or coding or working with the shell.  It took a bit to get together, but I&#8217;m really enjoying it.</p>


	<p>The sidebar is still under active development, and I&#8217;d like to get search and comments extensions going, too.  And I&#8217;m still not too sure about the colors.  I am slightly colorblind, but I&#8217;m trying to stay away from my &#8220;bad&#8221; colors.  Let me know if you particularly like or dislike it&#8230; or if you simply can&#8217;t read things.  Of course, until I get those comments going, you&#8217;ll just have to email me.</p>
