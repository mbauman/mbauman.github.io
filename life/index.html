It was quite a blast, and dad put up some of the pictures on <a href="http://faculty.kutztown.edu/bauman/chicagoblues.html">his website</a>. Boy, did they wear me out! I tell ya&#8217;&nbsp;—&nbsp;it&#8217;s a lot of work bouncing around the city every day! <br /><br /></p> <p class=info >Posted by Matt on Jun 10, 2007</p> </div> <div class=entry > <h3><a href="2007/05/29/on-the-lsd/index.html">On the LSD</a></h3> <p style="float:left"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/119/Picture021.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/121/Picture021_160.jpg" title="On my bike again.

It was wet and rainy until they kicked us off the road, at which point the sun immediately emerged and the clouds completely cleared from the sky. I got two flats, as well. (The first was from a shard of glass, which I fixed with the spare I brought along. I went to the bike-fixing-station to get it pumped up, and the guy there promptly broke the valve.) Even so, it was great to get back on the bike and just cruise without interruption.</p> <p>And yes, I am missing a tooth.</p> <a href="2007/05/29/on-the-lsd/index.html#extended">Continue Reading&#8230;</a> <p class=info >Posted by Matt on May 29, 2007</p> </div> <div class=entry > <h3><a href="2007/05/21/lies-lies/index.html">Lies, Lies!</a></h3> <span class=subtitle >(Every-time you close your eyes...) </span> <p style="float:left"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/77/Arcade_Fire_800.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/75/Arcade_Fire_300.jpg" title="The Chicago Theatre Marquee: Arcade Fire" alt="The Chicago Theatre Marquee: Arcade Fire" /></a></p> <p>What a blast. A few months ago, Jesse and I managed to grab some of the last tickets for the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=23203991">Arcade Fire</a> shows in Chicago. Not kidding&nbsp;—&nbsp;I searched for singles immediately after we got our pair (others were interested in going, too), but none were to be had. The concert was last night, and what a show it was. I am continually impressed by their musicianship; I can&#8217;t count the number of instruments they bounced between. Even a <em>Bass</em> Saxophone made an appearance.</p> <p>It&#8217;s always refreshing to get out and be reminded how live music is <em>supposed</em> to sound. And the Chicago Theatre is gorgeous (we even had fancy box seats).</p> <p class=info >Posted by Matt on May 21, 2007</p> </div> <div class=entry > <h3><a href="2007/05/19/the-temporary-crowns/index.html">The Temporary Crowns</a></h3> <p>Here&#8217;s the after photo. The dentist on Thursday fitted me with temporary crowns, so I really haven&#8217;t been walking around with a big hole in my mouth. For a temporary quick fix, I&#8217;m pretty impressed. They don&#8217;t quite match, and boy do they feel weird. My nerves from the old teeth were removed, so they really don&#8217;t hurt at all.</p> <p>That said, I certainly am not going to be eating any caramel apples anytime soon. Or anything that I have to bite off with my front teeth, for that matter.</p> <p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/69/Crowns_440.jpg" /></p> <p>Yesterday at work someone mentioned that I should just screw the replacement implants and just go for a grill. I think it&#8217;s a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/71/grillz.png">marvelous idea</a> (thanks for lending them to me, Nelly). Insurance will cover that, right?</p> <p class=info >Posted by Matt on May 19, 2007</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id=sidebar-wrapper > <div id=sidebar > <h3>Recent posts</h3> <ul> <li><a href="2008/10/20/worth-a-million-campaign-promises/index.html">…Worth a million campaign promises</a> <li><a href="2007/06/10/the-blues/index.html">The Blues</a> <li><a href="2007/05/29/on-the-lsd/index.html">On the <span class=caps >LSD</span></a> <li><a href="2007/05/21/lies-lies/index.html">Lies, Lies!</a> <li><a href="2007/05/19/the-temporary-crowns/index.html">The Temporary Crowns</a> <li><a href="2007/05/17/ouch-/index.html">Ouch.</a> <li><a href="2007/05/14/a-brighter-shade-of-fuchsia-2000-miles/index.html">A Brighter Shade of Fuchsia: 2,000 Miles!</a> </ul> (<a href="../rss/life/index.html"><span class=caps >RSS</span> Feed</a>) <h3>Archives</h3> <ul> <li><a href="2008/10/index.html">October 2008</a> <li><a href="2007/06/index.html">June 2007</a> <li><a href="2007/05/index.html">May 2007</a> </ul> <h3>Other sections</h3> <ul> <li> <a href="../geek/index.html">Geeky Stuff</a> <li> <a href="../gallery/index.html">Photos</a> <li> <a href="../about/index.html">About</a> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <hr class=hidden  /> <div id=footer > <p>Copyright &copy; 2008-2011, <a href="../about/index.html">Matt Bauman</a>.
