	<p>Well, not quite.  This picture is on my way home from biking the Lake Shore Drive.  It was wet and rainy until they kicked us off the road, at which point the sun immediately emerged and the clouds completely cleared from the sky.  I got two flats, as well.  (The first was from a shard of glass, which I fixed with the spare I brought along. I went to the bike-fixing-station to get it pumped up, and the guy there promptly broke the valve.)  Even so, it was great to get back on the bike and just cruise without interruption.</p>


	<p>And yes, I am missing a tooth.</p>

	<p>What a blast.  A few months ago, Jesse and I managed to grab some of the last tickets for the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=23203991">Arcade Fire</a> shows in Chicago.  Not kidding&nbsp;—&nbsp;I searched for singles immediately after we got our pair (others were interested in going, too), but none were to be had.  The concert was last night, and what a show it was.  I am continually impressed by their musicianship; I can&#8217;t count the number of instruments they bounced between.  Even a <em>Bass</em> Saxophone made an appearance.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s always refreshing to get out and be reminded how live music is <em>supposed</em> to sound.  And the Chicago Theatre is gorgeous (we even had fancy box seats).</p>

  <h3><a href="19/the-temporary-crowns/index.html">The Temporary Crowns</a></h3>
  
  <p>Here&#8217;s the after photo.  The dentist on Thursday fitted me with temporary crowns, so I really haven&#8217;t been walking around with a big hole in my mouth.  For a temporary quick fix, I&#8217;m pretty impressed.  They don&#8217;t quite match, and boy do they feel weird.  My nerves from the old teeth were removed, so they really don&#8217;t hurt at all.</p>


	<p>That said, I certainly am not going to be eating any caramel apples anytime soon.  Or anything that I have to bite off with my front teeth, for that matter.</p>

	<p>Yesterday at work someone mentioned that I should just screw the replacement implants and just go for a grill.  I think it&#8217;s a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/71/grillz.png">marvelous idea</a> (thanks for lending them to me, Nelly).  Insurance will cover that, right?</p>

  <h3><a href="14/a-brighter-shade-of-fuchsia-2000-miles/index.html">A Brighter Shade of Fuchsia: 2,000 Miles!</a></h3>
  
  <p style="float:left"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/27/bike_800.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/25/bike_160.jpg" title="That's as clean as she gets. Click for bigger." alt="That's as clean as she gets. Click for bigger." /></a></p>


	<p>Yesterday afternoon I took the time to take apart my bicycle and clean it thoroughly.  It had probably been over a year since I had given it a complete overhaul, and it was definitely showing.  The grime was plastered on thick; the rims were dirty and the chain was noisy and the wheels were out of true.  It&#8217;s absolutely ridiculous how much of Chicago ends up on my bicycle.</p>


	<p>The proof is in the pudding — today I took it out to go to work, and I just about flew over my handlebars when I hit the brakes for the first time.  What a difference it made getting that grime off the rims.  And, for the first time I can remember, I averaged over 17 miles per hour on my way to work <em>without a tailwind</em>.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/31/odo_800.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/29/odo_160.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>It was good timing, too.  I&#8217;ve been trying to hit 2000 miles in one year (That&#8217;s averaging 40 miles a week for all seasons of the year, including winter!).  I arrived in Chicago last year just in time for <a href="http://www.bikethedrive.org">Bike the Drive</a>, and I started my odometer at the beginning of the ride, so this year&#8217;s event (I just registered — I can&#8217;t wait!) was my deadline.</p>
