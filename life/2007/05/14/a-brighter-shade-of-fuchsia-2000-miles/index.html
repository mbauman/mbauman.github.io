It had probably been over a year since I had given it a complete overhaul, and it was definitely showing. The grime was plastered on thick; the rims were dirty and the chain was noisy and the wheels were out of true. It&#8217;s absolutely ridiculous how much of Chicago ends up on my bicycle.</p> <p>The proof is in the pudding — today I took it out to go to work, and I just about flew over my handlebars when I hit the brakes for the first time. What a difference it made getting that grime off the rims. And, for the first time I can remember, I averaged over 17 miles per hour on my way to work <em>without a tailwind</em>.</p> <p style="float:right"><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/31/odo_800.jpg"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/29/odo_160.jpg" alt="" /></a></p> <p>It was good timing, too. I&#8217;ve been trying to hit 2000 miles in one year (That&#8217;s averaging 40 miles a week for all seasons of the year, including winter!). I arrived in Chicago last year just in time for <a href="http://www.bikethedrive.org">Bike the Drive</a>, and I started my odometer at the beginning of the ride, so this year&#8217;s event (I just registered — I can&#8217;t wait!) was my deadline.</p> <div id=extended > <p>Well, it was such a nice day today I decided to take off from work a bit early and head down the bike trail. I got to the Museum of Science and Industry and realized I only needed to go another half mile for the round-trip to push me over. I arrived at home, looked down, and sure enough — 2,000.0 miles on the dot! Whoo! And my bike was all nice and shiny for the occassion — perfect timing!</p> <p>Just four more years before I run out of digits (although I suppose that if it&#8217;s smart, it&#8217;ll just drop the tenths). Oh&#8230; just in case you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s what came off my Bike yesterday:</p> <p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/33/grime1.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mbauman.net/page_attachments/35/grime2.jpg" alt="" /> Ewww.</p> </div> <p class=info >Posted by Matt on Monday, May 14, 2007</p> </div> </div> <div id=sidebar-wrapper > <div id=sidebar > <h3>Recent posts</h3> <ul> <li> <a href="../../../../2008/10/20/worth-a-million-campaign-promises/index.html">…Worth a million campaign promises</a> <li> <a href="../../../06/10/the-blues/index.html">The Blues</a> <li> <a href="../../29/on-the-lsd/index.html">On the <span class=caps >LSD</span></a> <li> <a href="../../21/lies-lies/index.html">Lies, Lies!</a> <li> <a href="../../19/the-temporary-crowns/index.html">The Temporary Crowns</a> <li> <a href="../../17/ouch-/index.html">Ouch.</a> <li> <a href=index.html >A Brighter Shade of Fuchsia: 2,000 Miles!</a> </ul> <h3>Archives</h3> <ul> <li><a href="../../../../2008/10/index.html">October 2008</a> <li><a href="../../../06/index.html">June 2007</a> <li><a href="../../index.html">May 2007</a> </ul> <h3>Other sections</h3> <ul> <li> <a href="../../../../../geek/index.html">Geeky Stuff</a> <li> <a href="/">About</a> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <hr class=hidden  /> <div id=footer > <p>Copyright &copy; 2008-2011, <a href="/">Matt Bauman</a>.
