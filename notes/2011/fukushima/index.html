Rumors and fears abound, without much evidence to support or dismiss either. And the official information stream has been less-than-forthcoming about what is going on inside the plant. Here&#39;s my attempt at piecing it all together:</p> <p>Radioactivity levels in the plant are high <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup>. They have evacuated all but about 50 persons. This group already has an ominous nickname – the Fukushima 50 <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fndef:2" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup>. Two days ago, three workers already had already reported symptoms of acute radiation sickness <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fndef:3" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup>. I haven&#39;t seen any reports of illness since then, but the radioactivity has only worsened since then. I don&#39;t believe anyone has dared to quantify their long-term effects; it&#39;s likely to be disastrous. Readings of up to 400mSv per hour have been reported. Acute sicknesses start at around 1000, and there&#39;s approximately a 50&#37; mortality rate for a one-time, rapid dose of 7,500mSv &#40;LD50&#41;. These are slower rates of radiation, so the body will be more resilient, but I fear and grieve for these people. They&#39;re battling their crippled equipment through fatigue, radiation, and explosion after explosion.</p> <p>Radiation levels off-site are lower but still worrisome <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fndef:4" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup> &#40;this is an official pdf from TEPCO in Japanese, as of about 8 hours ago&#41;. These readings are gamma-radiation at the main gate of the facility. By my rough calculations, were somebody simply standing at those meters, they wouldn&#39;t be close to showing the symptoms of acute poisoning. They would, however, have experienced the equivalent of several CT scans. A CT scan in a 20-year-old woman may increase her lifetime risk of cancer by ~2&#37; <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fndef:5" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup>. The levels have been decreasing since the fire was put out yesterday, but are still far from normal.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Japan, radiation levels have been reported as 10 to 23 times higher than background <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fndef:6" class=fnref >[6]</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fndef:7" class=fnref >[7]</a></sup>. Note that even were these levels to persist for an entire calendar year, one would still be within OSHA&#39;s occupational limits &#40;by my calculations&#41;. Unfortunately, this means that radioactive Cesium and Iodine are indeed escaping from the plant &#40;they&#39;ve measured Cesium in Tokyo&#41; <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fndef:8" class=fnref >[8]</a></sup>. Unlike most of the radioactivity that was vented at Three Mile Island, these elements decay slowly and will stick around for much longer than a few hours &#40;months to years&#41; and they are needed in our bodies. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll know the full scale of this disaster for quite some time.</p> <p>Despite the panicked rush on Iodine tablets on the west coast, even in the &#40;newly revised&#41; worst-case scenarios, no such &quot;deadly plume cloud&quot; would reach the US <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fndef:9" class=fnref >[9]</a></sup><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fndef:10" class=fnref >[10]</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fndef:15" class=fnref >[11]</a></sup> &#40;this last reference is cool: it&#39;s a meteorologist modeling particulate spread&#41;. None of the explosions are nuclear in nature, nor will they be. When water is put under enough stress &#40;e.g., heat&#41;, the hydrogen and oxygen disassociate, resulting in the extremely flammable mixture that&#39;s been causing explosion after explosion. Note, too, that all reports are saying that the primary nuclear reaction has been reduced to a minimum; it should be impossible for reaction to accelerate and cause a super-critical nuclear event. </p> <p>Currently, there appear to be two major sources of leaking radioactivity: &#40;The Japanese Atomic Industrial Forum has a great chart summarizing the status; looks like folks are regularly updating from it at Wikipedia <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fndef:16" class=fnref >[12]</a></sup>&#41;</p> <p>There was an explosion and fire in the spent fuel storage area outside of Reactor #4 <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fndef:11" class=fnref >[13]</a></sup>. It is unclear if the fuel itself was burning. Spent fuel, despite its somewhat-innocuous-sounding name, is still radioactive and still generates heat as those unstable particles decay <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fndef:12" class=fnref >[14]</a></sup>. I presume that this why they are still stored on-site and why thy must be cooled. But, it seems like it was not held in the same sort of containment as the core &#40;&quot;Academics &#91;in London&#93; were perplexed by the idea. &#39;The fuel pins in the pond should be totally contained,&#39;&quot; said a professor of nuclear safety <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fndef:13" class=fnref >[15]</a></sup>&#41;. Unfortunately, as system after system fails, it appears as though the cooling systems for these spent fuel rods also failed.</p> <p>There was a similar explosion last night, but unlike all the others, this one occurred <em>within</em> the containment of Reactor #2 <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fndef:13" class=fnref >[15]</a></sup>. The pressure inside this outer containment has equalized with the atmosphere, signifying a leak. As far as I can see, there has been no comment on the status of the other containment levels &#40;the fuel rods and the pressure vessel&#41; in Reactor 2. But it looks bad.</p> <p>Again, Japan has been reluctant to change the status of the disaster but it is clearly worsening. The French nuclear agency has reassessed the disaster and now rate it as a 6/7 <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fndef:14" class=fnref >[16]</a></sup>. TMI was 5; Chernobyl was 7.</p> <p>Interestingly, the design of these reactors was questioned back in 1972 <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fndef:5" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup>. It was dismissed in a memo stating that the PR backlash of requiring the existing plants to be decommissioned &quot;could well be the end of nuclear power.&quot;</p> <h2 id=march_17_update_plots ><a href="#march_17_update_plots" class=header-anchor >March 17 Update: Plots&#33; </a></h2> <p>I&#39;ve aggregated this data from TEPCO&#39;s regular releases of radiation readings like <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fndef:4" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup> &#40;The west gate - 西門 - at Fukushima Dai-ichi only&#41;. The data that I parsed from these PDFs is available <a href="http://pastebin.com/WvLvLvYu">as a CSV</a>.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to line up spikes in the data with documented events in the news:</p> <p><a href="/assets/notes/rad1.png"><img src="/assets/notes/rad1.png" alt="annotated graph of radiation in microSieverts per hour over time" /></a></p> <h2 id=march_18_update ><a href="#march_18_update" class=header-anchor >March 18 Update:</a></h2> <p>This is a slight re-working of the graphic to more clearly note discontinuities: the gaps in the line represent missing data for more than 2.5 hours. The cumulative exposure was simply estimated with a trapezoidal integration of the data. Due to these large discontinuities, it is only a rough estimate — and likely an underestimate. I&#39;ve annotated this graph with common references for both instantaneous and cumulative exposures, plotted it on a logarithmic scale, and fit an exponential decay line to the most recent segment.</p> <p><a href="/assets/notes/rad2.png"><img src="/assets/notes/rad2.png" alt="" /></a></p> <h4 id=footnotes ><a href="#footnotes" class=header-anchor >Footnotes</a></h4> <p><table
